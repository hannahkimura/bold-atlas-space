Experiments in psycholinguistics allow us to test hypotheses
and build theories. However, psycholinguistic experiments of-
ten suffer from low ecological validity, because participants are
often required to perform an unusual task in the face of unusual
materials. In the current experiment, we test the predictions of
Noisy Channel Processing in a naturalistic task: identifying
the lyrics of a song.
