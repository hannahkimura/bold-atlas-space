      Current Contributions: 
      - [tree-sitter-objectscript](https://github.com/hkimura-intersys/tree-sitter-objectscript): syntax highlighting for the [objectscript](https://docs.intersystems.com/irislatest/csp/docbook/DocBook.UI.Page.cls?KEY=GCOS_intro) language.  
      - [objectscript-lsp](https://github.com/hkimura-intersys/objectscript-lsp): a language server (with `tower-lsp` for the lsp protocol) for objectscript. This is still a work in progress, and I am currently working on go-to def, code completion, and semantic analysis (type-checking, undefined vars, etc).

    summary: |
     - Developed an AI chatbot using a RAG framework trained on domain knowledge/schema, alongside direct LLM queries, to debug FHIR-to-OMOP transformation exceptions by generating SQL to inspect relevant tables and suggest resolution steps, cutting resolution time from weeks to minutes.
     - Implemented a pod-based Rundeck runner on Kubernetes, integrated with PagerDuty Run Actions to automate running diagnostic runbooks when a relevant incident is triggered.
     - Migrated all cloud infrastructure to Terraform to reduce human error and improve auditability

I am a Systems Developer on the Advanced Research Projects team at InterSystems. My work is at the intersection of systems design, AI, and programming languages. I studied CS at Wellesley College and MIT, where I am still doing research with [TedLab](https://tedlab.mit.edu) to model real-life phenomenon using information-theoretic principles.
